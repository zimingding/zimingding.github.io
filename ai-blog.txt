12:T9ca,<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I build my blog from scratch using AI and Next.js. While Claude generated most of the code, I had to tweak it significantly to make it compile and work. I used GitHub Pages for hosting. It took me around 3-4 hours, most of the time spent on trouble shooting due to the code generated by Claude is not up to date. So I have to google and stackoverflow quite a lot. It's fascinating how quickly I got it running, this will take days if I write everything by myself.</p>
<h2>Technial Setup</h2>
<p>Its build with Next.js, react, and a few additional packages for displaying markdown. When I run "npm run build" it compiles the entire website into static content so there is no backend API calls or databases. This follows the principle of simplicity.</p>
<p>GitHub serves as my 'database' - it stores my source code and host the blog. I must emphasize that this task <strong>can't</strong> be done without coding experience. You need to be very technical to fix the compile error and unblock yourself. ChatGPT hallucinated several times when it cannot find the correct answer (maybe I didn't prompt correctly). Either way I feel only a skilled developer can effectively use AI and complete this project.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>I encountered several TypeScript compile errors, which can be fixed by either adjusting the types, such as</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">export default async function Post({
     params }: { params: Promise&#x3C;{slug: string}> })
</code></pre>
<p>Or mute TypeScript error for a quick fix</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">&#x3C;h2>
    &#x3C;Link href={`/${post.slug}`}>
    {/* 
// @ts-expect-error: Ignore */}
    {post.frontMatter.title}
    &#x3C;/Link>
&#x3C;/h2>
</code></pre>
<p>But the toughest part was deploying to GitHub Pages, I need to add a <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/bypassing-jekyll-on-github-pages/">.nojekyll</a> file so that deployment in GitHub Actions can include "_next" folder that has css. And sadly ChatGPT has no clue, seems Google search is still very much needed.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When working with relatively new or fast-evolving technology like Next.js, AI can generate outdated code. In these cases, Developer experience is essential - to read compile error or documenations to get back on track.</p>
<p>It seems we have traded hands-on coding for speed by offloading much of the code to AI. Now that we don't write most of the code ourselves, how do we keep our skills sharp?</p>
